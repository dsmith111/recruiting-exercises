# Challenge Notes

Hello, my name is David Smith and this is my solution to the inventory allocation challenge. All of the files are within the "src" folder.

## Instructions for running tests

This program was written within python 3, so if you are on a computer with a python interpreter installed, then simply run the UnitTestingForChallenge.py with the inventory_allocation.py file in the same directory (using the python3 command if relevant). 

<hr/>

If you are on a windows 10 x64 machine, with no interpreter, then there is an included .exe file you may run.

<hr/>

Finally, if none of the above is possible then this can also be run using google colab: 

<ol>
    <li>Download the inventory_allocation.py file.</li>
    <li>Open this google colab link:
        <ul>
            <li>https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1sJfjWQxSkkY9Ghdn6Z2SwVwM0e2ERAdX</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Upload the inventory_allocation.py file to the session storage(The little folder on the left).</li>
    <li>Run the tests normally.</li>
</ol>
